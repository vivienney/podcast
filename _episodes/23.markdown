This week Sam M([@samjbmason](https://twitter.com/samjbmason)) and Sam B([@sam_billingham](https://twitter.com/sam_billingham)) answer a listener question - “if you have an idea for a site or and app or just a piece of code and you find something very similar on sites like Github. What is to stop you copying the repository making small amends and passing these off as your own (assuming you had no morals)”. With the open source nature of large code projects and thousands of developers uploading their code to websites like Github when is it okay to use other peoples code? Is it copying or learning to take code from a project online?
