This week Sam([@samjbmason](https://twitter.com/samjbmason)) and Sam([@sam_billingham](https://twitter.com/sam_billingham)) talk about CSS frameworks. We start off by talking about the different ones that are out there, what are the pros and cons of them and what other options are available if you fancy something a bit more lightweight. We also answer a question on how we as developers focus on projects.
