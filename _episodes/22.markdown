This week Katie G([@katgrog](https://twitter.com/katgrog)) and Sam B([@sam_billingham](https://twitter.com/sam_billingham)) talk about some of the challenges you might go through in your first year as a web developer. Year one can be a difficult mental battle as you deal with personal comparison and feeling of inadequacy. The tools to combat this are honesty with yourself and colleagues and slowly learning to be okay with your current skills and progress. If you are struggling with your amount of knowledge versus the vast amounts available - know you are not alone.
