This week we are joined by a special co-host Alice Mollon([@alicemollon](https://twitter.com/alicemollon)) who talks to Sam([@samjbmason](https://twitter.com/samjbmason)) about what it likes to design and build projects at Steer and how she transitioned from tools like InDesign & Illustrator to designing in the browser with code. We also ask Alice about where she finds her design inspiration and how she goes about fixing problems with her code.
