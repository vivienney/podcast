This week Sam([@samjbmason](https://twitter.com/samjbmason)) and Sam([@sam_billingham](https://twitter.com/sam_billingham)) talk about what goes into making a podcast. Starting with what equipment we use to record the Steercast and what hardware you should invest in (Hint: Microphones). We also cover how to get a podcast into iTunes and how best to track downloads, as well as discussing how to decide on a schedule that works for you and your listeners.
