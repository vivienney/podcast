This week Sam B([@sam_billingham](https://twitter.com/sam_billingham)), Alice M([@alicemollon](https://twitter.com/alicemollon)) and Louise B([@blishop](https://twitter.com/blishop)) talk through three student questions.

1. Should I become an iOS or Web Developer?
2. Before I learn to code can you test if I'll be any good at it?
3. Is it frustrating when languages keep getting updated?
